This is a machine learning program designed to look at MIDI files and attempt to "compose" a MIDI file with similar characteristics. For example, this repository has several MIDI files containing AC/DC guitar riffs that can be used with the program to create a unique guitar riff in the style of AC/DC.

## Required Libraries
This project is coded in Python and uses the following libraries:
Keras (for the deep learning code)
music21 (for analyzing the MIDI files)
